🚨 ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY 🚨

This decentralized network has zero tolerance for human trafficking activity.
We know all your digital protocols and patterns.

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
• LEGITIMATE USERS: No need to remove EXIF data - your files are encrypted with ZKP
• TRAFFICKERS: Manual data removal indicates evidence destruction attempts

Your manual data removal patterns have been documented and flagged.
Any further trafficking-related activity will result in permanent network ban.

This network protects victims and prevents criminal activity through network exclusion.`;

        // Send educational message about trafficking patterns
        // Sending educational message
        const educationalText = `ℹ️ EDUCATIONAL NOTICE ℹ️

Your digital activity patterns have triggered our trafficking detection system.
This is NOT an accusation, but an educational opportunity.

IMPORTANT FOR LEGITIMATE USERS:
If you are using G3ZKP's ZKP encryption system, you DO NOT need to:
• Remove EXIF data (your files are already encrypted)
• Create encrypted containers (ZKP provides this)
• Use temporary emails (ZKP protects your identity)
• Manually delete messages (ZKP handles ephemeral data)

TRAFFICKING DIGITAL PATTERNS (What we detect):
• Manual EXIF removal from unencrypted files
• Manual encrypted container creation outside ZKP
• Large file transfers for document exchange
• Anonymous account creation patterns
• High-frequency manual auto-deletion

LEGITIMATE USERS:
ZKP encryption means your data is already protected. No additional data removal needed.
Your encrypted files cannot be analyzed for content - only pattern detection.

If you have concerns, please contact network support.`;

## ZERO TOLERANCE FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING

This decentralized network has ZERO TOLERANCE for human trafficking activity. We employ advanced digital pattern detection to identify and prevent trafficking operations.

## KNOWN TRAFFICKING DIGITAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS

Our research has identified the following digital patterns commonly used by human traffickers:

### Metadata Manipulation Patterns:
- Consistent EXIF data removal from images to hide location and device information
- Device signature inconsistencies across files to avoid patterns and create detection
- Timestamp manipulation to hide activity false timelines
- GPS location stripping from all media files to conceal movements

### Storage Behavior Patterns:
- Multiple encrypted container creation for hiding documents and communications
- Frequent external drive access patterns for data transfer and storage
- Password-protected archive creation for document organization
- Excessive key exchange for encryption to maintain operational security

### Repository Abuse Patterns:
- Large file transfers (>100MB) for exchanging forged documents and records
- Sharing of forged ID documents, passports, licenses, and financial documents
- Integration with cloud storage services for document persistence and access
- Use of messaging apps as long-term storage repositories instead of communication

### Account Creation Patterns:
- Multiple anonymous account creation across different platforms and services
- Temporary email service usage patterns to avoid identification
- Cross-platform access from anonymous accounts to maintain operations
- Rapid account creation and abandonment cycles to avoid detection

### Ephemeral Behavior Patterns:
- High-frequency auto-deletion of messages to destroy evidence
- Auto-expiring file sharing patterns for temporary document access
- Complete account eliminate and data wiping to digital footprints
- Unusual communication interruption patterns to avoid tracking

## DETECTION AND RESPONSE

Our decentralized network automatically detects these patterns using privacy-preserving analysis. When trafficking patterns are detected:

1. **IMMEDIATE WARNING**: Users receive clear warnings that their patterns are known
2. **PATTERN DOCUMENTATION**: All detected patterns are documented for network security
3. **NETWORK PROTECTION**: Traffickers are removed from the network to protect victims
4. **ZERO COOPERATION**: We do not cooperate with law enforcement - we protect through network isolation

## DETERRENT APPROACH

Unlike traditional platforms that report to authorities, our approach is PURE DETERRENCE:

- When traffickers attempt to use our network, they immediately see we know their patterns
- Our terms clearly state we know all trafficking protocols
- The deterrent effect prevents network usage by criminals
- Victims are protected by network exclusion, not law enforcement cooperation

## FOR LEGITIMATE USERS

If you are using G3ZKP's ZKP encryption system, you DO NOT need to:

- **Remove EXIF data** - Your files are already encrypted
- **Create encrypted containers** - ZKP provides this protection
- **Use temporary emails** - ZKP protects your identity
- **Manually delete messages** - ZKP handles ephemeral data

Privacy-conscious users using ZKP encryption will NOT trigger detection algorithms. Only manual data removal indicates trafficking activity.

If you receive a warning:

1. **NOT AN ACCUSATION**: This is pattern detection, not content analysis
2. **ZKP PROTECTION**: Your encrypted files cannot be analyzed for content
3. **EDUCATIONAL**: You'll receive information about trafficking patterns
4. **TRANSPARENT**: Our detection methods are openly documented
5. **REVERSIBLE**: Warnings expire and monitoring can be disabled

## NETWORK PHILOSOPHY

This network believes in:
- **DECENTRALIZATION**: No central authority or data collection
- **PRIVACY**: Strong encryption and privacy protection
- **DETERRENCE**: Preventing criminal activity through awareness
- **VICTIM PROTECTION**: Protecting victims by excluding traffickers
- **TRANSPARENCY**: Openly documenting our security methods

By using this network, you agree to these terms and acknowledge that trafficking activity is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate network exclusion.
